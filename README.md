# Novelette
An alternate/succesor to the Interactive CYOA Creator, which is good, but doesn't do everything I wanted the way I wanted. So I've made Novelette, which you can use to 
play and create visual novels, text adventures, and, of course, Choose Your Own Adventure-esque games.
It was made to *look* better and *do* more, with a lot of customizability and a sleek finish.

This is not a replacement, and this is not because I dislike the Interactive CYOA Creator, I actually really like it, but I wanted to make something new.
